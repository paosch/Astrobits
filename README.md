### Astrobits ###

A static website created as the final project for CodeFirstGirls/BAML frontend course for beginners.

## Languages and libraries used ##
* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Bootstrap, JQuery

## How to see the website ##

1. Clone this repository
2. Open it in a text editor (Atom, Sublime Text, etc)
3. Right click on index.html and copy the file's full path

# What did I learn?

I learnt how to use HTML and CSS with a tiny bit of javaScript and jQuery. It is the first time I do it without following a tutorial.

# What did I struggle with?

Bootstrap's card-columns class
Making the audio element work the way I wanted


# For the future

* As soon as I have more time to work on this project, I will fix the moving card (Uranus) on page 3, I will work more on making the pages responsive and I will make the images on page 3 reflect the planets' proportional size to each other.
* The site could be part of a science (Astronomy-focused) educational project. The next two sections could be, for example, 'We are made of star material' and 'Why does the moon doesn't fall down'.
