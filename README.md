Then visit [https://paosch.github.io/Astrobits/](https://paosch.github.io/Astrobits/) or do the following:

1. Clone this repository 
2. Open the project in a text editor (Atom, Sublime Text, etc)
3. Right click on index.html and copy the file's full path
4. Paste the path in the browser's address bar

### Work in progress ###

* As soon as I have more time to work on this project, I will fix the flickering card (Uranus) on page 3, I will work more on making the pages responsive and I will make the images on page 3 reflect the planets' proportional size to each other.
* The site could be part of a science (Astronomy-focused) educational project. The next two sections could be, for example, 'We are made of star material' and 'Why does the moon doesn't fall down'.
