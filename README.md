### Work in progress ###

* As soon as I have more time to work on this project, I will fix the moving card (Uranus) on page 3, I will work more on making the pages responsive and I will make the images on page 3 reflect the planets' proportional size to each other.
* The site could be part of a science (Astronomy-focused) educational project. The next two sections could be, for example, 'We are made of star material' and 'Why does the moon doesn't fall down'.
